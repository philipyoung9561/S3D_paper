	abstract = {Understanding the mechanism by which proteins fold to their native structure is a central problem in protein science. Clearly, interactions between residues that are in contact in the folded state (native interactions) are likely to be important for folding, but, in principle, nonnative interactions may play a role. Here, we use recently published microsecond to millisecond all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of proteins folding and unfolding to show, remarkably, that nonnative contacts are irrelevant to the mechanism of folding in most cases. This statistical analysis would be very difficult to perform by experiment. Although this is a limited set of proteins, the results nonetheless strongly support coarse-grained theoretical and simulation models of folding in which only native contacts are energetically favorable.The recent availability of long equilibrium simulations of protein folding in atomistic detail for more than 10 proteins allows us to identify the key interactions driving folding. We find that the collective fraction of native amino acid contacts, Q, captures remarkably well the transition states for all the proteins with a folding free energy barrier. Going beyond this global picture, we devise two different measures to quantify the importance of individual interresidue contacts in the folding mechanism: (i) the log-ratio of lifetimes of contacts during folding transition paths and in the unfolded state and (ii) a Bayesian measure of how predictive the formation of each contact is for being on a transition path. Both of these measures indicate that native, or near-native, contacts are important for determining mechanism, as might be expected. More remarkably, however, we found that for almost all the proteins, with the designed protein Î±3D being a notable exception, nonnative contacts play no significant part in determining folding mechanisms.},

Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 ÎŒs and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

Both IR temperature jump and ultrafast fluorescence mixing methods reveal a single-exponential process consistent with a minimal folding time of 3.2 {\textpm} 1.2 ÎŒs (at â50{\textdegree}C), indicating that a protein can fold on the 1- to 5-ÎŒs time scale. Furthermore, the single-exponential nature of the relaxation indicates that the prefactor for transition state (TS)-folding models is probably >=1 (ÎŒs){\textendash}1 for a protein of this size and topology. Molecular dynamics simulations and IR spectroscopy provide a molecular rationale for the rapid, single-exponential folding of this protein. Î±3D shows a significant bias toward local helical structure in the thermally denatured state. The molecular dynamics-simulated TS ensemble is highly heterogeneous and dynamic, allowing access to the TS via multiple pathways.},

The structure of Î±3D was not based on any natural protein, and yet it shows thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties typical of native proteins. A variety of features contribute to its unique structure, including electrostatics, the packing of a diverse set of hydrophobic side chains, and a loop that incorporates common capping motifs.

    abstract = { Macromolecular systems are composed of a very large number of atomic degrees of freedom. There is strong evidence suggesting that structural changes occurring in large biomolecular systems at long time scale dynamics may be captured by models coarser than atomistic, although a suitable or optimal coarse-graining is a priori unknown. Here we propose a systematic approach to learning a coarse representation of a macromolecule from microscopic simulation data. In particular, the definition of effective coarse variables is achieved by partitioning the degrees of freedom both in the structural (physical) space and in the conformational space. The identification of groups of microscopic particles forming dynamical coherent states in different metastable states leads to a multiscale description of the system, in space and time. The application of this approach to the folding dynamics of two proteins provides a revised view of the classical idea of prestructured regions (foldons) that combine during a protein-folding process and suggests a hierarchical characterization of the assembly process of folded structures. }

Over the past decade, a rigorous mathematical theory has been formulated to define optimal collective variables to characterize slow dynamical processes. Here we review recent developments, including a variational principle to find optimal approximations to slow collective variables from simulation data, and algorithms such as the time-lagged independent component analysis. Using these concepts, a distance metric can be defined that quantifies how slowly molecular conformations interconvert. Extensions and open questions are discussed."

    abstract = { Identification of the main reaction coordinates and building of kinetic models of macromolecular systems require a way to measure distances between molecular configurations that can distinguish slowly interconverting states. Here we define the commute distance that can be shown to be closely related to the expected commute time needed to go from one configuration to the other, and back. A practical merit of this quantity is that it can be easily approximated from molecular dynamics data sets when an approximation of the Markov operator eigenfunctions is available, which can be achieved by the variational approach to approximate eigenfunctions of Markov operators, also called variational approach of conformation dynamics (VAC) or the time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA). The VAC or TICA components can be scaled such that a so-called commute map is obtained in which Euclidean distance corresponds to the commute distance, and thus kinetic models such as Markov state models can be computed based on Euclidean operations, such as standard clustering. In addition, the distance metric gives rise to a quantity we call total kinetic content, which is an excellent score to rank input feature sets and kinetic model quality. }

ABSTRACT = {Rare, but important, transition events between long-lived states are a key feature of many molecular systems. In many cases, the computation of rare event statistics by direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is infeasible, even on the most powerful computers, because of the immensely long simulation timescales needed. Recently, a technique for spatial discretization of the molecular state space designed to help overcome such problems, so-called Markov State Models (MSMs), has attracted a lot of attention. We review the theoretical background and algorithmic realization of MSMs and illustrate their use by some numerical examples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to using MSMs for the efficient solution of optimal control problems that appear in applications where one desires to optimize molecular properties by means of external controls.},

We show that eigenfunctions of Markov matrices can be used to construct coordinates called diffusion maps that generate efficient representations of complex geometric structures. The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods."

    abstract = { The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the molecular dynamics propagator (or transfer operator) contain the essential information about the molecular thermodynamics and kinetics. This includes the stationary distribution, the metastable states, and state-to-state transition rates. Here, we present a variational approach for computing these dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This approach is analogous to the variational approach used for computing stationary states in quantum mechanics. A corresponding method of linear variation is formulated. It is shown that the matrices needed for the linear variation method are correlation matrices that can be estimated from simple MD simulations for a given basis set. The method proposed here is thus to first define a basis set able to capture the relevant conformational transitions, then compute the respective correlation matrices, and then to compute their dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors, thus obtaining the key ingredients of the slow kinetics. }
